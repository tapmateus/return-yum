Then quickly stir in the melted butter.Divide the batter between the prepared popover cups. They should be about 3/4 of the way full.Bake the popovers for 20 minutes and then reduce the heat to 350F. Bake for another 10 or 15 minutes. The popovers will be very golden brown.My preference is to serve immediately and enjoy them warm!  \n",

       "4  In a blender or food processor, whirl eggs, all-purpose and buckwheat flours, and milk until smooth, scraping down sides of container as necessary. The buckwheat flour may settle as batter stands; stir before cooking if necessary.                                                                                                 Set a nonstick frying pan 8 inches across bottom over medium-high heat; when hot, brush bottom with butter, then wipe out excess with a paper towel.                                                                                                 Lift pan from heat and pour in 1/4 cup batter; immediately tilt pan and swirl batter to coat bottom. Crpe should set at once and form tiny bubbles. Set pan back over heat and cook crpe until lightly browned at the edge and dry-looking on the surface, 1 to 3 minutes.

You can either use softened butter to easily grease the popover cups, or melted butter and use a brush to thoroughly brush the cups. You can pour any leftover butter in the bottom of each cup. Place the pan in the oven and preheat it for 2 minutes.\\n\\nBlend Ingredients: Add all remaining ingredients to a blender and blend until all ingredients are thoroughly mixed. The batter will look similar to a crepe batter.\\n\\nBake: Pour the batter in the preheated muffin cups ¾ of the way through. You should have enough to make 12 popovers. Transfer the pan to the oven on the middle rack and place a large baking sheet on the lower rack, in case there's any spillage. Bake for 30 minutes. Make sure to check them so they don't over-brown. Gently slip them out of the pan and serve.  "
