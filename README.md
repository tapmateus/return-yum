# Return-Yum

## Overview

This project was made during Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp with the goal of using Web Scraping and API's techniques learned during classes.
The final objective of this project is for the user to save money and avoid food wasting. To do do, the user inputs the leftovers he has on the fridge - ingredients - and the tool web scrapes Continente Supermarket webpage - www.continente.pt - to gather the value of his leftovers (as Continente brand product) to calculate the price - so, the savings - the user is making by not throwing it in the garbage. Also, an API was used - https://spoonacular.com/food-api - to, given the same input - return possible recipes with the ingredients input.
